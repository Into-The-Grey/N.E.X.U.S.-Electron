# N.E.X.U.S.-Electron: Personal AI Assistant Desktop Application

## Overview

NEXUS is an advanced personal AI assistant designed to emulate the functional aspects of the fictional JARVIS AI from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This desktop application, developed using Electron, is focused on providing an intuitive natural language user interface (UI) for efficient interaction and task management. The application is designed for use on Ubuntu 24 LTS, with plans to expand support to Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms.
